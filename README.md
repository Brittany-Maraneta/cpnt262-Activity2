# CPNT 262 Activity 2: Before & After Variables

## Brittany Maraneta

## Resources

Using modzilla and w3schools to understand the JS terms and baselines to be able to do the activity. W3Schools also helped me by testing my code on their test column to understand my code without all the extras added to it.

Asking for my partner to be the viewer to test the visibility and creating of the HTML - is it usable for the viewer and does it make sense with the assignment prompts.

There is still so many things I have to learn. I struggle a lot with understanding when the function goes where and what variable to call or name it. I learnt JS is so sensitive and spelling or not using the right "#" or "" or even "." can easily break it; so understanding to slow down and really make sure I am checking it top to bottom as well as being use to knowing how to DeBug.

A big bug I came across with was, I put my script link on the top of the pg without defer and it made my bottom codes not work. I used w3Schools to see if my code worked on there and then had to read my code a few times until I saw that my link was on the bottom. So then I put it on the top. Which then in class, we were reminded to use defer to be able to do it on the top and so I was able to finalize the script link on the top of the body and it worked!
